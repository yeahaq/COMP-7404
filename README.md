# COMP-7404: An effective intrusion detection approach using SVM with naïve Bayes feature embedding

## Overview
This project reproduce all the numerical results, figures, and other experiments of the paper **An effective intrusion detection approach
using SVM with naïve Bayes feature embedding**. We use CICIDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 to test the performance of the proposed method and other types of data to test its generalization. The goal is to develop a robust model capable of identifying and preventing intrusion attempts in network environments.

## Datasets

### 1. CICIDS2017 Dataset
- **Link**: [CICIDS2017 Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)
- **Description**: This dataset contains labeled network flows, including real-world benign and attack traffic data. It provides a comprehensive set of features captured over a five-day period, ensuring a diverse representation of network activities and attacks.

### 2. UNSW-NB15 Dataset
- **Link**: [UNSW-NB15 Dataset](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset)
- **Description**: The UNSW-NB15 dataset is designed for network intrusion detection. It includes a variety of synthetic and real attack scenarios, making it a valuable resource for training and evaluating IDS models.

### 3. Breast Cancer Wisconsin and Pima Indians Diabetes Database

## Rough Experimental Results

We successfully ran the code and got the result. Moreover, we visualized the results, and compared our experimental results with the data in the original paper and the results are analyzed. The experimental results are generally consistent with the paper, and we will conduct experimental analysis.
